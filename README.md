# 3DLayeredElastic

3DLayeredElastic is a Python tool for analyzing the behavior of 3D structures with multiple layers under various loading conditions. Built on top of the PyMastic library, it offers flexibility and power for engineers and researchers working with layered materials.

**Key Features:**

* **3D Analysis:** Supports x,y,z directions
* **Multiple Loads:** Supports more than 1 load
* **PyMastic Integration:** Leverages the [PyMastic](https://github.com/Mostafa-Nakhaei/PyMastic) package.

**Getting Started:**

There are two ways to use 3DLayeredElastic:

**1. Google Colab:**

* Click on the link to the Jupyter notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/egemenokte/3DLayeredElastic/blob/main/PythonLEA.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/egemenokte/3DLayeredElastic/blob/main/PythonLEA.ipynb).
* This notebook provides detailed instructions, examples, and explanations for using the code.

**2. Manual Installation and Execution:**

* Download or clone the repository.
* Open the script `Module3D_Huang` in the `Run` folder.
* Modify the parameters within the script to match your specific analysis needs.
* Run the script.

**Additional Information:**

* For more comprehensive details and usage examples, refer to the provided Jupyter notebook (`PythonLEA.ipynb`).
* Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues and pull requests on GitHub.
